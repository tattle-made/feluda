## Tattle Code of Conduct

Tattle is a civic tech project emanating from India that aims to make verified information more accessible to mobile first users, in languages that they are comfortable with. It is a multi stakeholder project that welcomes people from all backgrounds to contribute to this goal.

We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. We acknowledge that not everyone has the time, financial means, or capacity to actively participate, but we recognize and encourage involvement of all kinds. We facilitate and foster access and empowerment. We are all learners.

While participating in discussions in online and IRL tattle spaces

* **Be mindful of your language.** Any of the following behavior is unacceptable:
  * Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
  * Threats of violence
  * Deliberate intimidation
  * Sexually explicit or violent material that is not contextualized and preceded by a considerate warning
  * Unwelcome sexual attention
  * Stalking or following
  * Or any other kinds of harassment

  Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.

* **Be respectful.** Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.
* **Be considerate.** Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community.
* **Be open minded.** Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [manage@tattle.co.in](mailto:manage@tattle.co.in). Please include your name and a description of the incident, and we will get back to you ASAP.

Sometimes, participants violating the Code of Conduct are unaware that their behavior is harmful, and an open conversation clears things up to move forward. However, if a participant continues with the behavior, the tattle team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all tattle spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other community members or the general public.
