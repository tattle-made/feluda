# Contributing to Tattle Search
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Communication Channel
You can use Github issues to communicate with us. If you require more real time and frequent back and forth, we recommend joining our slack channel. You can request access by filling this [form](https://tarunima.typeform.com/to/BxZjfv)

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/tattle-made/tattle-api/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
