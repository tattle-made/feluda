Given an audio file, this methods finds a vector of 2048 dimensions using PANNs. PANN is a CNN that is pre-trained on lot of audio files. They have been used for audio tagging and sound event detection. The PANNs have been used to fine-tune several audio pattern recognition tasks, and have outperformed several state-of-the-art systems. 

### Embeddings for vector audio search

Audio embeddings are often generated using spectrograms or other audio signal features. In the context of audio signal processing for machine learning, the process of feature extraction from spectrograms is a crucial step. Spectrograms are visual representations of the frequency content of audio signals over time. The identified features in this context encompass three specific types: 
- Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
- Chroma features: Chroma features represent the 12 distinct pitch classes of the musical octave and are particularly useful in music-related tasks. 
- Spectral contrast: Spectral contrast focuses on the perceptual brightness of different frequency bands within an audio signal.  

## Implementation left
To run this operator, we also have to install `wget`. this is not currently being installed in the Dockerfile. A step to perform is 
```sh
apt-get install wget
```
This will now make sure the operator is running

## How to Run the Test
The operator and the test file can be found at `src/core/operators` folder in the codebase. The operator is named `audio_vec_embedding.py` and the test file is named `test_audio_vec_embedding.py`

To run the test, simply just run the test file
```
python -m unittest test_audio_vec_embedding.py
```
