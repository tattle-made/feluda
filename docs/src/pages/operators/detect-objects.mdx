## Documentation for Object Detection using YOLO

You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It is trained on the COCO dataset.

I am using the segment model of YOLO -> YOLOv8 segment - https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/#models

it's easy to setup and use YOLO

First, we have to install the `ultralytics` library 
```
pip install ultralytics
```

then just setup YOLO object detection like this
```
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('yolov8n-seg.pt')
result = model.predict('path/to/your/image', save=True, imgsz=1024, conf=0.5, project='sample_data', name='output')
```

The output image will be saved in `sample_data/output` folder, and the resulting image will be titled as `output.png`. This image will have bounding boxes with objects detected and will also show the segmented area. 

## How to Run the Test

The operator and the test file can be found at `src/core/operators` folder in the codebase. The operator is named `detect_objects.py` and the test file is named `test_detect_objects.py`

To run the test, simply just run the test file
```
python test_detect_objects.py
```

This will initiate the test and first the YOLO models `.pt` file will be downloaded, after the tests runs, you should get an `OK` message in the terminal indicating that the test has run successfully.

The output image will be saved in `sample_data/output` folder, and the resulting image will be titled as `output.png`. This image will have bounding boxes with objects detected and will also show the segmented area.
