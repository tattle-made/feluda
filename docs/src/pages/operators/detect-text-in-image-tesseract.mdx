## Documentation for Tesseract OCR Operator

For each language support, we need to install separate tesseract operators for each language. Right now the current operator only supports English and Hindi languages. 

For Linux, you can follow these links to understand how and what modules to install for each language.

To extract text from an image, we pass the image through a tesseract function like this

```
data = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, lang='eng+hin', config='--psm 6 --oem 1')
```

Here the config settings help us define some more insight into the image and LSTM blocks for the image extraction engines. 

You can take a look at the operator and the test of the operator for the entire code.

## How to Run the Test

The operator and the test file can be found at `src/core/operators` folder in the codebase. The operator is named `detect_text_in_image_tesseract.py` and the test file is named `test_detect_text_in_image_tesseract.py`

To run the test, simply just run the test file
```
python test_detect_text_in_image_tesseract.py
```

The test will check if text was extracted correctly or not, it will fetch an sample image from the `sample_data` folder. You should get an `OK` message in the terminal indicating that the test has run successfully.
